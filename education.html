    <h1>My Education</h1>
    <p style="font-size:22px;">My cousin brother has played a pivotal role in my journey to master HTML, a foundational language in web development. His guidance and expertise have been instrumental in helping me grasp the intricacies of HTML. From the very beginning, he patiently explained the essential HTML tags, attributes, and their proper usage. His structured approach ensured that I built a strong foundation in this language, which is crucial for any aspiring web developer.
        I want to express my deep appreciation to my cousin brother for his tireless efforts in teaching me HTML. His mentorship has been invaluable, and I owe much of my proficiency in HTML to his dedication. He not only taught me the syntax and semantics but also emphasized the importance of writing clean and accessible code. His encouragement to experiment and apply what I've learned in practical projects has been transformative for my learning journey.
        My cousin brother's guidance has gone beyond just technical knowledge; he has instilled in me a passion for web development and a commitment to continuous learning. His advice on staying updated with emerging web technologies has been invaluable. I am truly grateful for his patience, his willingness to share his expertise, and his belief in my potential as a web developer. With his guidance, I look forward to further exploring HTML and expanding my skills in the world of web development.</p>
